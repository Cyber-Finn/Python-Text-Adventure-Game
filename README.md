# Text-Based Adventure Game
A modular text-based Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) game written in Python.
<br>
The beauty of the simple design of this game/engine is that it allows anyone to create their own custom text-based game from it by changing a few files.
<br> 
To do this, you need to create your own quest/item/character files (generally in Modules/Scenes/Assets), and the underlying engine will manage item/quest/character selection, handle inputs/outputs, etc.
<br>
You can also use the example scene's (dungeon_intro.py) code I've written as a guide. 

## Note
I may convert this into a graphical game when done, but the project is still a Work in Progress.
