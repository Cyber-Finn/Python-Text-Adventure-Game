# Text-Based Adventure Game
A modular (you can use it to make your own custom) text-based Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) game written in Python.
<br>
This project is still far from being done, but the real beauty in the very simple design is that it allows anyone to create their own custom text-based game from it. 
<br> 
To do this, you need to create your own quest/item/character files, and the underlying engine will manage item/quest/character selection, handle inputs/outputs, etc.

## Note
I may convert this into a graphical game when done, but the project is still far from being done.
